An Open Source Project's README file should contain instructions on how to pay the Maintenance Fee. Most projects on GitHub that require a Maintenance Fee use GitHub Sponsors.

Since most projects are on GitHub, we will focus on GitHub Sponsors. Again, always check the project's README file to verify if and how to pay the Maintenance Fee.

### GitHub Sponsors pay flow

<Steps>

1. Click on the `Sponsor` button at the top of the project on GitHub.

2. Select the appropriate "Maintenance Fee" sponsorship tier and complete the payment information.

3. Repeat for each project you use.

</Steps>

See the [GitHub Sponsors documentation][sponsors] for more information.
