## Open Source Software is free, but Open Source Project maintenance is expensive

Open Source Software is free, but maintaining an Open Source Project is far from free. We ask a lot of the maintainers of a project, including:

* Triage issues
* Answer questions
* Keep build scripts working
* Update software dependencies
* Track security reports
* Produce new releases
* Tackle spam in the discussion forums and issue trackers
* Maintain domain name registration
* Renew signing certificates
* And many, many other chores

Clearly, maintainers are vital to the ongoing success of an Open Source Project. The Open Source Maintenance Fee is a simple and sensible way to pay for the time and effort they spend sustaining a project.

If you, your organization or your project makes money, you need to [pay the fee to each project you depend on that requires an Open Source Maintenance Fee](/consumers/which/).
